                                &nbsp; &nbsp;Iron Man possesses powered armor with many models that gives him superhuman strength and durability,
                                flight, and an array of weapon (repulsor rays, the uni-beam projector, energy sheild,
                                pulse bolts, etc).

                                &nbsp; &nbsp;By rewriting his own biology, Stark is able to save his life, gain an enhanced healing factor, and 
                                partially merge with the Iron Man armor, superseding the need for bulky, AI-controlled armors in favor 
                                of lighter designs, technopathically controlled by his own brain. His enhanced technopathy extends to 
                                every piece of technology, limitless and effortlessly due to his ability to interface with communication 
                                satellites and wireless connections to increase his "range".

                                &nbsp; &nbsp;Tony Stark is an inventive genius whose expertise in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and 
                                computer science rivals that of Reed Richards, Hank Pym, and Bruce Banner, and his expertise in 
                                electrical engineering and mechanical engineering surpasses even theirs.

                                &nbsp; &nbsp;Doctor Strange is a practicing sorcerer who draws his powers from mystical entities such as Agamotto, 
                                Cyttorak, Ikonn, Oshtur, Raggadorr, and Watoomb, who lend their energies for spells.

                                &nbsp; &nbsp;Strange also wields mystical artifacts including the Cloak of Levitation which enables him to fly, 
                                the Eye of Agamotto, an amulet whose light is used to negate evil magic, the Book of the Vishanti, 
                                a grimoire which contains vast knowledge of white magic, and the Orb of Agamotto, a crystal ball 
                                which is used for clairvoyance.

                                &nbsp; &nbsp;her main ability was a vaguely defined "hex power" that could cause random and unlikely things 
                                to affect her enemies or other targets, often in the form of "bad luck." These effects could be 
                                unpredictable, however, and thus not always helpful to Wanda. The vague and unpredictable nature 
                                of her power meant Wanda could use her ability in a variety of ways that helped the plot but also 
                                meant she couldn't easily solve all her problems.

                                &nbsp; &nbsp;Due to her unique genetics, Wanda is a nexus of magical energy, able to instinctively tap into 
                                different mystical power sources more easily than even highly trained sorcerers. Because of this, 
                                Wanda has temporarily grained the power to alter reality on multiple occasions by taking energy 
                                from another person or outside force

                                &nbsp; &nbsp;Valkyrie is the strongest of all Valkyrior. Like all her people, her body is several times denser than 
                                that of humans. She is not immortal, but she ages far more slowly than humans. Valkyrie is immune to 
                                all earthly diseases and is difficult to injure. Her Asgardian physiology grants her enhanced levels of 
                                stamina. Valkyrie can perceive the approach of death, in the form of a "deathglow" surrounding a person's 
                                body. She does not know how death will come but she can tell that it is imminent. Valkyrie can transport 
                                herself and a dying or dead body to and from the realm of the dead by willing it. Valkyrie has had extensive 
                                training in sword fighting as well as unarmed combat and horseback riding. Her natural fighting ability is 
                                among the best of all Asgardians, matched only by Sif.

                                &nbsp; &nbsp;Valkyrie carries two weapons of choice.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        An enchanted sword named Dragonfang. A wizard named Kahji-Da was said to have carved the sword from 
                                        a tooth of an extra-dimensional dragon. The sword eventually passed into the possession of the Ancient 
                                        One, who in turn gave it to his disciple Doctor Strange. Strange went on to return it to the Valkyrie 
                                        after she had bequeathed the virtually indestructible Black Knight's Ebony Blade to its rightful owner.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>An unnamed iron spear.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Valkyrie rides a winged horse named Aragorn. Aragorn was given to her by the current Black Knight.[48]
